I was tasked with building a Portfollio website but unfortunately my website is all over the place. 
I changed my mind so many time about how I wanted it to look and the theme I had for it that I completely made a mess of the code.
I feel as though I didnt have enought time to configure my idea but I'm hoping to be able to go back and finish my vision.
I had a lot of trouble trying to get my image to be set as the background and reflect that in the HTML.
At first I wanted to do a Frog theme which you will see in my screenshot ive included, but then I wanted to do a more "Medieval" style which is where I really messed things up.
My vision was to have my logo I made on Canva in the middle and then have each link be in a gothic style font.
I wanted to have various swords and flails as the icon images next to my buttons that would take you to my linked websites.
Unfortunately right now my code is in skeletal form with some random esq code thrown in. 

I dont know what I was thinking with the frogs but I spent a lot of time playng around with the shape of this box and box-shadowing.

Here is my custom logo I created and sort of the theme I was going for
